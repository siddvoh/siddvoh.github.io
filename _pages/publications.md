## Research Experience

### Independent Research
*June 2020 - Present*

- Conducted independent research with mentors from Hitachi R&D and Thoughtworks, spanning traditional machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and computer vision
- Co‑authored a COLING 2025 paper introducing a multiple‑choice question benchmark for Hindi and Kannada educational texts and providing LLM‑based baseline difficulty‑estimation models.
- Benchmarked Temporal Ensembling semi‑supervised models across diverse vision datasets, analysing intra‑class variability impacts in collaboration with Hitachi R&D; findings published at COMSYS 2023
- Initiated and led a project to benchmark coding‑question difficulty using LLMs, developing a BERT‑style model for automatic programming‑problem complexity estimation.
- Explored computer‑vision techniques for pedestrian‑attribute recognition and person re‑identification, evaluating multiple network architectures to improve identification accuracy in security applications.
- Built reproducible pipelines to fine‑tune GPT, Claude, Llama and Gemma models with LoRA/QLoRA, enabling single‑GPU experimentation.
