# Hello, I'm Sidd!

I’m a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher based in Pittsburgh, PA. At the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, I build AI-native products end to end. I’m also pursuing a Master’s in Computer Vision at Carnegie Mellon University, where I’m engaged in related research.

Previously, I built production-grade ML systems powering AWS Bedrock, AWS Transcribe, and AWS Translate, bridging applied machine learning with robust backend infrastructure to deliver scalable, reliable applications across speech and language. I earned a Bachelor's in Mathematics–Computer Science from UC San Diego in 2022. My foundations in mathematics, computer science, and AI pair with hands-on, cloud-native experience using AWS SageMaker, Bedrock, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

## About Me

My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning engineering and AI research. I’m particularly excited about developing systems that can learn to interpret, analyze, and generate multi-modal information. As part of my graduate studies and independent research, I’ve been exploring areas like image classification, representation learning, and visual reasoning. I’ve worked on published AI research centered on making models more efficient, reliably multi-lingual, and usable in real-world settings.

Outside of work, I’m deeply interested in the future of AI systems that blend language, vision and reasoning, and in pushing the boundaries of model capabilities in multilingual and multimodal settings.
