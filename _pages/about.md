# Hello, I'm Siddharth!

I’m a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher currently based in Seattle, WA. I work at Amazon Web Services (AWS) AI, where I focus on building production-grade machine learning systems that power services like Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Translate, and AWS Bedrock. My work bridges the gap between applied machine learning and robust backend infrastructure, enabling scalable and intelligent applications across speech and language domains.

I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a degree in Mathematics–Computer Science in 2022. My academic foundation in mathematics and computer science complements my hands-on experience building systems in cloud-native environments using tools like AWS SageMaker, Bedrock, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

## About Me

My interests lie at the intersection of software engineering and AI research, with a growing focus on computer vision. I’m particularly excited about developing systems that can learn to interpret, analyze, and generate visual information. As part of my graduate studies and independent research, I’ve been exploring areas like image classification, representation learning, and visual reasoning. I’ve also contributed to published work on educational QA and multilingual processing, with a broader goal of improving model generalization and usability across real-world applications.

Professionally, I’ve worked on high-impact projects involving automatic speech recognition (ASR), model optimization, and end-to-end pipeline deployment in production environments. I’m experienced in collaborating across engineering, research, and product teams to deliver ML features that scale globally. I enjoy working on challenging technical problems—from designing new service architectures to fine-tuning models and optimizing inference pipelines.

Outside of work, I’m deeply interested in the future of AI systems that blend language and vision, and in pushing the boundaries of model capabilities in multilingual and multimodal settings. I’m also an advocate for open, reproducible research and enjoy collaborating with others in the ML community.
